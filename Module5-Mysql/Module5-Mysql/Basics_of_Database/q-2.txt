Question-2  What is Normalization?

->Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
->Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
->The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.
->Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. 
->It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.


->   The main reason for normalizing the relations is removing these anomalies.
      Failure to eliminate anomalies leads to data redundancy and can cause data integrity and other problems as the database grows. 
      Normalization consists of a series of guidelines that helps to guide you in creating a good database structure.
